# SCI 常用句式

## Referring to Sources

学术写作的一个显著特征就是它来自已经知道的，以前做过的工作，和/或已经开发了的想法和模型。因此，在学术论文中，作者经常参考其他研究和其他作者的工作。作者通过这些文献引导读者很重要。<br/>

关于文献综述的说明：论文的文献总数部分的目的是以系统的方式向读者展示整个研究主题的已知内容，并概述关键思想帮助读者理解。<br/>

除系统化之外，还应该对当前工作相关的研究或想法进行评估和批判。

关于引用风格的注释： 作者引用其他资源的方式在不同学科中有所不同。某些情况下，如果个人作者很重要，作者的名字将成为该句的主语; 其他情况，作者名字只能在括号中或者通过数字符号。作者作为主语的风格在科学里很少见，在人文学科中更常用。不同的参考系统用于不同的学科。在这里给出的大多数例子中，使用了哈佛文本引用系统。<br/>

关于动词时态的注释： 对于文献的一般参考，倾向与使用现在完成时(has/has+动词分词)。对于过去进行的具体研究的参考，最简单的过去时是最常用的。通常情况下，过去特定日期或时间点构成句子的一部分。当提到作者的话语或者想法时，如果这些想法仍相关，则经常用现在时。
